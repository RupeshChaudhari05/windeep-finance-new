NEXT STEPS TO TEST:

1. LOGIN & VERIFY DATA
   - Open http://localhost/windeep_finance/admin/login
   - Login with admin/admin123
   - Go to Members → Search for "TEST" 
   - Verify 3 members appear

2. CREATE LOANS (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)
   - Go to Loans → New Loan Application
   - Select TEST001 (Rajesh Kumar)
   - Product: TEST-PL001
   - Amount: ₹100,000
   - Tenure: 12 months
   - Save and approve loan
   - Repeat for TEST002 and TEST003

3. UPLOAD BANK STATEMENT FOR MAPPING
   - File location: database/bank_statement_jan2025.xlsx
   - Go to Bank → Import Statement
   - Upload the Excel file
   - This creates 20 test transactions for mapping

4. TEST TRANSACTION MAPPING
   - Go to Bank → Unmapped Transactions
   - Should see transactions like:
     * TEST-UTR-001: ₹8,500 (EMI payment)
     * TEST-UTR-002: ₹8,500 (EMI payment)
     * TEST-UTR-006: ₹15,000 (SPLIT PAYMENT - Key Feature!)
     * TEST-UTR-004: ₹2,000 (Unknown sender)
     * TEST-UTR-005: ₹10,000 (Overpayment)

5. MAP TRANSACTIONS
   a) Map TEST-UTR-001 to TEST001's loan
   b) Map TEST-UTR-002 using phone detection
   c) **TEST SPLIT PAYMENT**: Map TEST-UTR-006 (₹15,000) as:
      - ₹8,500 to loan EMI
      - ₹6,500 to another purpose
   d) Map unknown transaction TEST-UTR-004
   e) Handle overpayment TEST-UTR-005

WHY NO LOANS IN TEST DATA?
Loans require complex calculations (EMI schedules, interest, etc.).
It's easier to create them through the UI where the system
calculates everything automatically. This ensures accuracy.
